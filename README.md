Project Title: School Network Implementation in Cisco Packet Tracer

Technologies Used:

Networking Tools: Cisco Packet Tracer

Network Components: Switches, Routers, Access Points, DHCP Server, DNS Server, IP Phones

Protocols & Services: VLAN, DNS, DHCP, Wi-Fi, Inter-VLAN Routing, Inter-WLAN routing IP Telephony

This project involves designing and configuring a school network infrastructure in Cisco Packet Tracer. 
The network includes both wired and wireless connections, allowing students, teachers, and administrative staff to access the internet and internal services securely. 
Key networking features such as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), Domain Name System (DNS), Wi-Fi access points, Inter-VLAN routing, Inter-WLAN routing
and IP telephony were implemented to simulate a real-world school environment.
